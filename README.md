# CASE: Cell-type-specific And Shared EQTL Fine-mapping

`CASE` is an R package designed for multi-trait fine-mapping analysis, with a particular focus on single-cell eQTL fine-mapping.

## 1. Installation

`CASE` can be installed from the [Github Repo](https://github.com/leaffur/CASE).

``` r
# Install the devtools package if you haven't already
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("leaffur/CASE")
```

## 2. Quick Start

For an introductory overview, please refer to [this vignette](https://leaffur.github.io/CASE/articles/Introduction_to_CASE.html).

After loading the package with `library(CASE)`, you can access simple examples and guidance using the `?CASE` command in R.

This is an early version of CASE, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
